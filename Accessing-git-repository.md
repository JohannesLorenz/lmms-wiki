### Anonymous Git

Assuming you have git installed, you first have to get a copy of the Git
repository:

	git clone https://github.com/LMMS/lmms.git

For instructions on how to compile LMMS, visit [[Compiling LMMS]].

If you want to update your copy simply type

	git remote update
	git pull

inside lmms-directory. The first step usually can be omitted.

### Browse Git code

For browsing the Git repository easily you can also use the [Git Web
interface](https://github.com/LMMS/lmms).
