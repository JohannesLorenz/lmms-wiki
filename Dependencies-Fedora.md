# Qt4
On Fedora 25:
```
dnf install qt4-devel libsndfile-devel fftw3-devel libvorbis-devel libsamplerate-devel libogg-devel stk-devel fltk-devel
```

# Qt5
```bash
#sorry, this area is under construction
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...done installing?  Next, [clone the source code](Compiling#clone-source-code)

## Troubleshooting
Note for Fedora users: For 32-bit VST support `wine.i686` and `wine-devel.i686` are required.
