The common way to contribute code to a project on GitHub is by forking it and creating a pull request after the changes are done. This is the workflow we recommend. 

If you don't have a GitHub account and don't want to sign up neither, you may just [create a patch file](#Patch) and send it to us.

## Using GitHub

### Add an SSH key
This must be only done once. Follow [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) to generate and add SSH keys to your github account.

### Fork the official LMMS repository
Do these steps:
* Go to [our github home](https://github.com/LMMS/lmms) and hit the fork button (top right).
* Clone your fork:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:yourusername/lmms.git
```

For more instructions on how to fork LMMS, see the GitHub help article [Fork A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). Having forked LMMS and cloned it to your hard drive, you can start working on the code.

### Pushing your changes to GitHub
After you made your changes and implemented your ideas, it's about time to push them to your git repository.
For doing this, you may use the command line, as it's explained below, or use `git gui` to open a graphical user interface, which can make things a lot easier if you're uncomfortable with the command line.

#### Reviewing your changes
You can list all changed files by running
```
$ git status
```
inside the source root directory. A more detailed view on what exactly has been changed is provided by
```
$ git diff
```

#### Staging and committing
The next step is to stage the changes you've made. To stage a file, run
```
$ git add FILENAME
```

After that, you have to commit your staged changes. To do so, run
```
$ git commit
```
You'll be asked to enter a commit message to summarize what you did. The staging area can also be skipped by just typing
```
$ git commit -a
```
This way all changes you made will automatically be staged and committed. Finally, push your commit:
```
$ git push
```

### Contributing your changes
(TODO: write down what exactly has to be done)

In order for your changes to be merged into the official repository, you should create a pull request.
You can find instructions on this topic in GitHubs article [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

### Further commits
Later on, if you want to make another commit, you must first (preferably
before making changes) rebase your fork on the upstream, ie. sync it
with the main LMMS repository. You can do this with the command:

```
$ git pull --rebase git://github.com/LMMS/lmms.git stable-0.4
```

## Using only a patch file <a name="Patch"></a>
To have your changes applied without using GitHub, create a patch file containing your changes by running
```
$ git diff > my-patch-for-lmms.diff
```
in the source root directory. Now you have a patch file we can easily apply. Just [contact us](https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/wiki#contact-us) about it.
